# Fireriver

This is an experiment at building a magical River of news in Firefox.

It's probably not worth using right now.

## Tips / Notes / Goals

* Fireriver will alert you whenever it notices a feed on any page you visit, and
    will offer the option to subscribe to that page or ignore it in the future.

* Fireriver will create a new bookmark folder named "Fireriver Feeds"

* Fireriver will use Live Bookmarks in this folder to build a [River of News][]
    page. You can view it by clicking the blue feed icon in the add-on bar.

* The space bar can be your main tool for paddling down the river.
    * If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, that's great.
    * The page down key works too, if you have it.  But, it's tiny.
    * Shift-space lets you back-paddle if you need to.

* You can add and remove Live Bookmarks in this folder like any other bookmark
    folder. The changes will be reflected in the river of news display.

* If you organize your Live Bookmarks with folders, Fireriver will let you view
    items filtered by those folders.

* If you leave the Fireriver page open, it will update itself whenever Live
    Bookmarks refresh with new items. (This may not always work, yet.)

* If anything seems broken, try reloading the page. Someday, you shouldn't need
    to do this, ever.

* Fireriver will try not to show you things you've seen before.

* Everything Fireriver knows is tied to your Live Bookmarks. If you delete
    them, Fireriver's data goes away too.
