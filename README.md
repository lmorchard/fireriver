# Fireriver

This is an experiment at building a magical River of news in Firefox that spies
on your browsing habits to find feeds.

It's probably not worth using right now, and is likely very horrible.

## Tips / Notes / Goals

* Fireriver will create a new bookmark folder named "Fireriver Feeds"

* Fireriver will use Live Bookmarks in this folder to build a [River of News][]
    page. You can view it by clicking the feed icon on the add-on bar.

* You can manually add a Live Bookmark to the "Fireriver Feeds" folder, and
    Fireriver will include it in the river.

* Fireriver will let you know whenever it notices a feed on any page you visit, and
    will offer the option to subscribe to that page or ignore it in the future.

* If you leave the Fireriver page open, it will update itself whenever Live
    Bookmarks refresh with new items.

* Fireriver will try not to show you things you've seen before.

* Everything Fireriver knows is tied to your Live Bookmarks. If you delete
    them, Fireriver's data goes away too.
